# Interactive Code Editor with Live Preview

A browser-based code editor that allows users to write, preview, and download their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in real-time. This tool is designed for web development learners and developers who want to prototype quickly.

- 📥 **Download**: Export your current code as a `.html` file and run it offline.
- 🧩 **No Backend Required**: 100% client-side — just open in any modern browser.
